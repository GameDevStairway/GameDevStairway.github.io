### About

You have learned how to program in Python. You have followed many tutorials but don't know where to go next. You tried to code your own games but never succeed to finish and release one. You want to go deeper in learning game development but you have no idea how to proceed. *You are in the right place.*

This website is intended to give you a complete path to learn game development, from the simplest game to modern games. The idea is to have a very progressive and systematic approach. We will learn from historic and successful games. Piece by piece, we will analyse what are their components, we will reproduce their key features using a common architecture, and we will reuse everything we code to produce more and more complex games.
